   IMDB Clone | React App | ReactJs Project
</h3>


<br><br>

<p align="justify">
This project is an attempt to create a clone of the popular IMDb (Internet Movie Database) website. It is a platform where users can search and discover movies and TV shows, read reviews and ratings, and more. The app is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ReactJS and makes use of a movie database API to retrieve movie information and display it in an easy-to-use interface.<br>
This React project will provide us the list of upcoming, popular & top rated movies. On clicking on any movie it will show us the detail page of the movie.<br>
The main features of the IMDb Clone Movies App include:
<ul>
<li align="justify"> <b>Movie search:</b> Users can search for movies and TV shows by title, actor, director, and more. The app provides detailed information about each movie, including its release date, running time, genre, and more.</li>
<li align="justify"> <b>User reviews:</b> Users can write and read reviews of movies and TV shows, as well as rate them on a scale of 1-10. This allows other users to get a better understanding of what to expect from a movie before watching it.</li>
<li align="justify"> <b>Recommendations:</b> The app provides personalized movie recommendations based on the user's viewing history and preferences. This helps users discover new movies and TV shows that they might be interested in.</li>
<li align="justify"> <b>Watchlist:</b> Users can keep track of the movies and TV shows they want to watch in the future by adding them to their watchlist. This makes it easy to find and watch the movies they're interested in later on.</li>
<li align="justify"> <b>Trending movies:</b> The app displays the most popular movies and TV shows currently trending on IMDb, making it easy for users to stay up-to-date with what's hot.</li>
</ul>
